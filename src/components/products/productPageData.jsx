      description1: 'The Class II, Type B2 Biosafety Cabinet is a benchtop model designed for versatility, offering multiple base stand options to function as a full console unit. Engineered for specialized applications, this cabinet ensures that the entire work zone is 100% exhausted through your facility’s internal exhaust system, making it ideal for safely handling minute quantities of volatile chemicals and trace amounts of radionuclides. ',
      description2: 'When used with proper technique, this cabinet serves as an effective primary engineering control, providing a robust safety solution. The Type B2 design minimizes the risk of exposure to airborne biological pathogens or particulate chemical agents, ensuring optimal protection for both personnel and products. By creating a dynamic air barrier at the front of the cabinet, it enhances safety in low to moderate risk-hazard environments, offering reliable containment and peace of mind.  ',
